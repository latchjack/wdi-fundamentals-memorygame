    <p>In the recent years, there has been a rise in the amount of games that are targeted towards strengthening the mind and are less likely to suffer with memory related illnesses like Alzheimer's when you get older. Nintedo's Brain Training series was one of the most famous.<br /><br /> The reason for all of these new titles is because it has been proven, that by playing games that make you utilise your memory, you are able to strengthen the mind. You are teaching your brain to access the memory more quicker and it fires the synapses to do so much faster than if you were to not play memory games.<br /> So by playing this game, not only are you having fun, you are also strengthening your mind, making your memory far better and also lowering your chances of brain-related illnesses that strike in our later years.</p>
